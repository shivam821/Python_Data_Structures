### Hashing (Hash Function)

**In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called hashing.** 

- Let k be a key and h(x) be a hash function.
- Here, h(k) will give us a new index to store the element linked with k.
